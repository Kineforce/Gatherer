# Gatherer

This is my conclusion project to the discipline of algorithms in the university.

It's a simple crud C project, but it doesn't have the option to update data.

With Gatherer, i can insert some demographic data about people, cities and states.

I person needs to be in a city, that needs to be in a state, assuming this, i can search 
for people and bring data filtering by any of the options that i've said above.

It has a demographic report, that returns all information stored.
